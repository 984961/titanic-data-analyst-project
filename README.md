🚢 Titanic Data Analysis

This project analyzes the Titanic dataset, one of the most famous datasets in the field of data science. 
The dataset provides information on the passengers aboard the Titanic, including demographics, ticket details, and survival status. 
Through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations, the goal is to uncover patterns and insights about what factors influenced passenger survival.

📊 Project Overview

Perform data cleaning and preprocessing

Generate descriptive statistics

Create visualizations to understand patterns in survival rates

Analyze relationships between survival and passenger attributes such as:

Age

Gender

Passenger class (Pclass)

Fare

Embarked port

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas – data manipulation

NumPy – numerical computations

Matplotlib – visualization

Seaborn – advanced visualization

Visualize survival distribution across gender, class, age groups, and embarkation ports

Correlation heatmap to identify important features

Insights into which factors had the strongest impact on survival

📷 Sample Visualizations

Count plot of survival distribution

Bar plots comparing gender/class survival rates

📦 Installation & Usage

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Titanic-Data-Analysis.git
cd Titanic-Data-Analysis


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the analysis:

jupyter notebook notebooks/titanic_analysis.ipynb

✅ Results & Insights

Women and children had higher survival rates compared to men.

First-class passengers had a significantly higher chance of survival compared to second and third class.

Embarkation port also played a role, with passengers from Cherbourg showing higher survival.

Age and fare had moderate correlation with survival probability.

📌 Future Work

Apply Machine Learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict survival.

Feature engineering for better prediction accuracy.

Deploy the model with a simple web app (Streamlit/Flask).
